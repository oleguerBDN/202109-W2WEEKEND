Game Of Life

I'm not a big fan of buttons and I love to keep designs simple. 
- Click any cell to make it live. 
- Use + and - keys to increase or decrease interval speed 
- Use backspace key to clean the game. 
- Use space to pause or resume the game. 
- Use arrow keys to make add/substract more cells. 
Arrow up will substract horizontal line, arrow down will add horizontal line, arrow left will substract vertical line and arrow right will add vertical line. 

Mobile version is more simple. Just "click" any cell to make it live.
